PostGres Data Modeling with Normalization and Database Creation

The purpose of the database is to analyze the JSON metadata on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The database will allow the analytics team to see the songs that users are listening to.

The fact table for the database schema design is the songplays table which is the central table that can be queried to find the data from the users, artists, songs, and time tables. Since the data that needs to be analyzed is the songs and user activity, the songplays table will connect to the most tables.
